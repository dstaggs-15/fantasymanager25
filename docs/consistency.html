            <h3>How to Use This Tool</h3>
            <p>This page helps you understand player volatility, which is crucial for making tough start/sit decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean PPG:</strong> A player's average fantasy points per game. Good for a baseline, but doesn't tell the whole story.</li>
                <li><strong>Std Dev (Standard Deviation):</strong> Measures how much a player's score varies from their average. <strong>A lower number is better</strong>, indicating a more consistent, reliable player.</li>
                <li><strong>Ceiling PPG:</strong> The player's 90th percentile score. This is their "boom" potential—the kind of score that can win you a week.</li>
                <li><strong>Floor PPG:</strong> The player's 10th percentile score. This is their "bust" potential—the score that can lose you a week.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency %:</strong> The percentage of games where the player scored above a useful baseline for their position (e.g., 10+ points for a RB). Use this to choose between players with similar averages.</li>
            </ul>
